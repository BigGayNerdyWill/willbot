# willbot
a bot of me, will<br><br>


basically its me but like a discord bot<br>
there is a token file for the discord account to be used, which i am not sharing for obvious reasons<br>
and this is the source code and i would put the actual model files in there but am unable to because they are much too large (>800MB)<br><br>

im happy with the program but this is only version 2 out of an expected 4, <br>see TODO for what needs to be changed for the later versions
